# Skol
**S**ome **k**ind **o**f **l**ibrary that I made for general purposes (also works in Browser via [Browserify](https://browserify.org/))
## Why?
Always when I make something in TypeScript, I always implement the same thing over and over. So to stop myself I made this. I just made it for me, but if you want to use it, you can.
## Install
Well, you can't install it with `npm install` or `yarn add` so you need to install it via this URL:
````sh
// NPM
npm install git+https://github.com/N1ghtTheF0x/Skol.git
// Yarn
yarn add git+https://github.com/N1ghtTheF0x/Skol.git
````
(Maybe I will upload it to NPM one day)
